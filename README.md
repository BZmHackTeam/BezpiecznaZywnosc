# Bezpieczna Żywność

**Codename:** SFood
**Description:** An application that enables users to view food contamination reports issued by GIS, get notified about such incidents and to submit their own reports of potential contamination to be reviewed by GIS.

## Tech stack

- ASP.NET Core WebAPI
- React in TypeScript
- Docker

## Purpose

This project aims to fill the void of sanitary monitoring and public disclosure of sanitary issues, for which no framework has been established, except from sparse ephemeral notices.
Instead, all sanitary announcements regarding food contamination will be processed and disclosed by this project, along with keeping the history of them and enabling data filtering and notification.
